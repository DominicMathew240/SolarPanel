## Login.txt v1.0

Description is the first version of the AI POC model, created by Dominic Mathew David

# Features
- Detect hotspot with thermal inspection, Model Architecture: YOLOv8, Mean Average Precision (mAP): 63.7%, Precision: 77.9%, Recall: 66.2%
- Confidence Threshold: The system allows users to set a confidence threshold, ensuring that only predictions with confidence above the specified level are considered.
- Overlap Threshold: Fine-tune the model's performance by adjusting the overlap threshold for more precise object detection.
- Predictions are presented visually on the uploaded image, Inference results are saved in a JSON file for further analysis.

## RoadMap & Future implementation
- [ ] Semantic Segmentation Analysis: Utilize SAM's capabilities to perform detailed semantic segmentation analysis, enabling the system to understand the context and relationships between different objects within an image. [planning]
- [x] User Annotation Interface: Introduce an annotation interface that allows users to manually label objects within images. This annotated data can be used for future training, enhancing the model's accuracy and adaptability. [planning]
- [x] Data Analytics Dashboard: Develop a user-friendly dashboard that provides statistical insights into the dataset, including object distribution, common patterns, and potential areas for model improvement. [planning]
- [ ] Active Learning Integration: Implement an active learning mechanism that intelligently selects the most informative images for manual annotation. This will optimize the annotation process by focusing on the images that contribute the most to improving the model's performance.
- [ ] Real-time Object Highlighting: Enable a real-time object highlighting feature in the user annotation interface. As users manually label objects, the system could provide instant feedback by dynamically highlighting the corresponding regions in the image, aiding users in making accurate annotations.
- [ ] Transfer Learning Insights:Incorporate a feature that analyzes and visualizes insights gained from transfer learning. This could include showing which pre-trained layers or features contribute the most to the model's understanding of specific objects. Understanding transfer learning dynamics can guide further model fine-tuning.

# Benefit of the Planning Features
1. Active Learning Integration:
Idea: Implement an active learning mechanism that intelligently selects the most informative images for manual annotation. This will optimize the annotation process by focusing on the images that contribute the most to improving the model's performance.
Benefits: Reduces the manual annotation workload by prioritizing images that bring the most value to the model. This can lead to a more efficient use of resources and faster model improvement.

2. Real-time Object Highlighting:
Idea: Enable a real-time object highlighting feature in the user annotation interface. As users manually label objects, the system could provide instant feedback by dynamically highlighting the corresponding regions in the image, aiding users in making accurate annotations.
Benefits: Enhances the user annotation experience by providing immediate visual feedback, potentially reducing annotation errors and improving the efficiency of the labeling process.

3. Transfer Learning Insights:
Idea: Incorporate a feature that analyzes and visualizes insights gained from transfer learning. This could include showing which pre-trained layers or features contribute the most to the model's understanding of specific objects. Understanding transfer learning dynamics can guide further model fine-tuning.
Benefits: Provides users with a deeper understanding of how the model leverages pre-trained knowledge, aiding in more informed decisions during model refinement. This feature can be valuable for users with varying levels of machine learning expertise.
